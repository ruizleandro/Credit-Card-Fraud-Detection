# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Project Objective 
The main objective of this project is to build a model that can be capable of detect fraudulent transactions without target labels, using unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

## Models Used
I'll start with two unsupervised machine learning models, mainly because I want to explore anomaly detection with unsupervised learning techniques so the algorithm can be used for detecting new forms of frauds.

For this task I'll use:
* *Principal Component Analysis:* to create a model that can learn and detect forms of fraud without the help of labels.
* *Independent Component Analysis:* so I can compare the different types of component analysis.
* *One-Class Support Vector Machines*: another type of unsupervised anomaly detection model.

## Project Summary
The project is divided in three main sections:
### Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section I review the data available in
### Model Selection

### Hyperparameter Tuning and Final Test
